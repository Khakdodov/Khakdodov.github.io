    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>Fast & Furious (originally The Fast and the Furious) is a media franchise centered on a series of action films that are largely concerned with illegal street racing, heists and spies. The franchise also includes short films, a television series, live shows, video games and theme park attractions. It is distributed by Universal Pictures.

The first film was released in 2001, which began the original trilogy of films focused on illegal street racing, and culminated in the film The Fast and the Furious: Tokyo Drift (2006). The series went under a change with Fast & Furious (2009), which transitioned the series toward heists and spying, and was followed by four sequels. F9 is set to be released in 2021, with a tenth and eleventh film planned. The main films are collectively known as The Fast Saga.</p>
